Basic salary calculator made with C++ only to get a bit of practice on dynamic arrays and arrays in general.

## 💿 Working Principle <a name = "built_using"></a>

- Program asks the user to enter the amount of months they have been saving for
- Program asks to enter the amount of money they saved each months via a for loop
